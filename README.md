# City-Graph
Self-implemented graph class (C++) with functionalities included breadth first search.
Cities are read in from the cities.txt file. The first line of the file contains the names of all the cities. Preceding lines start with
a given city name and specify what cities that city is connected to, and how far away they are. The program groups cities into districts
based on connections (or lack of connections) to other cities. Includes a "find shortest path" function that uses a breadth first search
method.
